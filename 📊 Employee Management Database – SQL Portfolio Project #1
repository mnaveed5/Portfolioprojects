Introduction:
This project demonstrates the setup of a simple employee database for a fictional company. The database, named SQLTutorial, consists of three key tables: EmployeeDemographics, EmployeeSalary, and Department. These tables help capture essential employee information such as demographic details, salary information, and departmental assignments.

The purpose of this setup is to illustrate basic SQL concepts, including table creation, data insertion, altering tables, updating data, and retrieving information through queries. This structure can be used as a foundational dataset for practicing joins, aggregations, filtering, and other SQL operations.

Outline:
1. Database Creation:
SQLTutorial database is created to store all the related employee data.
2. EmployeeDemographics Table:
Contains demographic information about employees:
EmployeeID (Unique identifier for each employee)
FirstName
LastName
Age
Gender
DepartmentID (Added later to establish department relationships)
3. Inserting Employee Demographic Data:
Data for 9 employees is inserted, representing a mix of departments and roles.
4. EmployeeSalary Table:
Contains salary and job title information:
EmployeeID
JobTitle
Salary
5. Inserting Employee Salary Data:
Salary and job title data for 8 employees are added.
6. Department Table:
Contains information about the departments:
DepartmentID (Primary Key)
DepartmentName
7. Inserting Department Data:
Four departments are added: Sales, Human Resources, Accounting, Manager.
8. Altering EmployeeDemographics Table:
A new column DepartmentID is added to associate employees with their respective departments.
9. Updating Department Assignments:
Based on the employee's job title, appropriate DepartmentID values are assigned to link employees to the correct departments.
10. Final Data Review:
Select statements retrieve the complete data from EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary to review the dataset and verify updates.
Potential Use Cases:


--POTENTIAL USE CASE FROM THIS DATA: 

Practice SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
Explore aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.
Perform filtering, sorting, and grouping.
Demonstrate data normalization concepts.
Build reporting dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau based on this dataset.
